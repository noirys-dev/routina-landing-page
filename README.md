# Routina — Product Landing Page (v1)

Routina is a minimal landing page concept for a habit and routine tracking app.

This project focuses on visual clarity, calm UI, and a cold metal / glass aesthetic.
It is an early version (v1) and intentionally kept simple.

## ✦ Purpose
The goal of this project is to explore:
- Minimal landing page structure
- Glassmorphism on dark backgrounds
- Subtle motion and hover interactions
- Design-to-code consistency

This is not a production-ready app — it is a visual and layout-focused concept.

## ✦ Built With
- HTML
- CSS (no frameworks)
- Custom hover and border animations

## ✦ Current Status
v1 — layout and visual direction completed.  
Further iterations may include responsiveness refinements and interaction improvements.
